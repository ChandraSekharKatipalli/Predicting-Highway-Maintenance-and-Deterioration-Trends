# Predicting Highway Maintenance and Deterioration Trends

Welcome to our capstone project on predicting highway maintenance and deterioration trends! This project leverages data fusion and machine learning techniques to forecast pavement deterioration using publicly available transportation datasets.

## Project Overview

Road maintenance decisions are often reactive due to a lack of predictive insights. This project aims to provide data-driven forecasts of road deterioration to support **proactive maintenance planning and resource optimization**.

We fused data from the **Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS)** and the **Freight Analysis Framework (FAF)** (2013â€“2022), engineered features, and applied machine learning models to predict pavement deterioration, measured via the **International Roughness Index (IRI).**
